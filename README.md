```

## üîß Configuration

### Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the root directory:

```env
# Deployment
PRIVATE_KEY=your_private_key_here
BASE_RPC_URL=https://mainnet.base.org
BASE_SEPOLIA_RPC_URL=https://sepolia.base.org
BASESCAN_API_KEY=your_basescan_api_key

# Frontend (update after deployment)
VITE_FAIR_TOKEN_ADDRESS=0x...
VITE_FAIR_MINER_ADDRESS=0x...
VITE_MINER_SALE_ADDRESS=0x...
VITE_MINING_STAKING_ADDRESS=0x...
VITE_REVENUE_DISTRIBUTOR_ADDRESS=0x...
VITE_PRIVACY_POOL_ADDRESS=0x...
```

## üìù Deployment Guide

### 1. Deploy Smart Contracts

```bash
# Deploy to Base Sepolia (testnet)
pnpm exec hardhat run scripts/deploy.ts --network baseSepolia

# Deploy to Base Mainnet
pnpm exec hardhat run scripts/deploy.ts --network base
```

### 2. Update Contract Addresses

After deployment, update the contract addresses in:
- `client/src/lib/web3.ts`
- `.env` file

### 3. Verify Contracts

```bash
pnpm exec hardhat verify --network base <CONTRACT_ADDRESS>
```

### 4. Start Emissions

```bash
# Call startEmissions() on MiningStaking contract
# This can only be done once by the owner
```

### 5. Deploy Frontend

The frontend can be deployed to:
- Vercel
- Netlify
- Cloudflare Pages
- Any static hosting service

```bash
cd client
pnpm build
# Upload 'dist' folder to your hosting provider
```
