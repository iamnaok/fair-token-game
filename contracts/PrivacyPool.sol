/**
 * @title PrivacyPool (DEPRECATED - DO NOT USE)
 * @dev This contract was removed due to security concerns
 * 
 * SECURITY NOTICE:
 * The original implementation claimed to provide privacy but did not actually do so.
 * It required revealing secrets during withdrawal, making all transactions fully traceable.
 * 
 * To implement true privacy, you would need:
 * 1. Zero-knowledge proofs (zkSNARKs)
 * 2. Merkle tree commitment scheme
 * 3. Proper nullifier system
 * 4. Similar architecture to Tornado Cash
 * 
 * This is a complex undertaking requiring:
 * - Specialized cryptographic libraries (circom, snarkjs)
 * - Trusted setup ceremony
 * - Professional security audit
 * - Legal compliance review
 * 
 * RECOMMENDATION:
 * If privacy is required, integrate with existing battle-tested solutions like:
 * - Railgun (if available on Base)
 * - Aztec Network (when available)
 * - Or remove privacy claims entirely
 * 
 * This file is kept as a placeholder to prevent compilation errors.
 * The frontend should remove all references to the privacy pool feature.
